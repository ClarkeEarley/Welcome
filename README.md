I am an Associate Professor of Chemistry. My research interests are in developing open-source programs that can be used by both researchers and students to address relevant scientific issues.

This is an initial test of github usage. No publicly interesting information is stored here.

Eventually, appropriate code for scientifically useful programs are expected to be added to this site. These include:
* **CH3M3D** - A web-based program for the interactive display of molecules.
* **HAPPEE** - A program for rapid calculation of atomic charges for both organic and inorganic compounds.

If you have any questions about any of the code on this site, feel free to ask.
